# 🎮 Content-Based Movie Recommender System  

## 📌 Overview  
This is a **Content-Based Movie Recommender System** built using Python. It suggests movies to users based on the similarity of movie features, such as genres, plot descriptions, and cast information. The system calculates similarity scores using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.  

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ Suggests similar movies based on user input  
- ✅ Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** for recommendation  
- ✅ Works with movie metadata (title, genre, description, etc.)  
- ✅ Built with **Python** and its core libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, etc.)  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **pandas** - Data processing  
- **scikit-learn** - TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity computation  
- **numpy** - Array operations  
- **pickle** - Model storage and loading  


## 📦 Installation  
### 🔹 1. Clone the repository  
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender-system.git  
cd movie-recommender-system  
```  

### 🔹 2. Install dependencies  
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

### 🔹 3. Run the recommender system  
```
python app.py  
```  

## 📝 How It Works  
1. Loads the movie dataset (metadata)  
2. Processes movie descriptions and genres  
3. Converts text data into numerical form using **TF-IDF Vectorization**  
4. Computes similarity scores using **Cosine Similarity**  
5. Retrieves and displays the most similar movies based on user input  

## 🎯 Example Usage  
```
Enter a movie name: Inception  
Recommended Movies:  
1. Interstellar  
2. The Prestige  
3. Shutter Island  
4. The Dark Knight  
```  

## 🚀 Deployment (Optional)  
You can deploy the application using **Streamlit**:  
```
streamlit run app.py  
```  

## 📌 Future Enhancements  
- 🔹 Improve recommendations using **Deep Learning** (Neural Networks)  
- 🔹 Deploy as a web app using **Flask/Django**  
- 🔹 Add user preferences and collaborative filtering
