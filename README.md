The system calculates similarity scores using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.  

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ Suggests similar movies based on user input  
- ✅ Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** for recommendation  
- ✅ Works with movie metadata (title, genre, description, etc.)  
- ✅ Built with **Python** and its core libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, etc.)  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **pandas** - Data processing  
- **scikit-learn** - TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity computation  
- **numpy** - Array operations  
- **pickle** - Model storage and loading
