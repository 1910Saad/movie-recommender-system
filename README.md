# 🎬 Content-Based Movie Recommender System

## 📌 Overview

This is a Content-Based Movie Recommender System built using Python. It suggests movies to users based on the similarity of movie features, such as genres, plot descriptions, and cast information. The system calculates similarity scores using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## 🚀 Features

Suggests similar movies based on user input

Uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity for recommendation

Works with movie metadata (title, genre, description, etc.)

Built with Python and its core libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, etc.)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

pandas - Data processing

scikit-learn - TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity computation

numpy - Array operations

pickle - Model storage and loading

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender-system.git
cd movie-recommender-system

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the recommender system:

python app.py

## 📜 How It Works

Loads the movie dataset (metadata)

Processes movie descriptions and genres

Converts text data into numerical form using TF-IDF Vectorization

Computes similarity scores using Cosine Similarity

Retrieves and displays the most similar movies based on user input

## 🎯 Example Usage

Enter a movie name: Inception
Recommended Movies:
1. Interstellar
2. The Prestige
3. Shutter Island
4. The Dark Knight

## 🚀 Deployment (Optional)

You can deploy the application using Streamlit:

streamlit run app.py

## 📌 Future Enhancements

Improve recommendations using Deep Learning (Neural Networks)

Deploy as a web app using Flask/Django

Add user preferences and collaborative filtering
